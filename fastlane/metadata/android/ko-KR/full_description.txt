TrackerControl allows users to monitor and control the widespread, ongoing, hidden data collection in mobile apps about user behaviour ('tracking').

To detect tracking, TrackerControl combines the power of the Disconnect blocklist, used by Firefox, and our in-house blocklist is used, created from analysing <i>~2 000 000</i> apps! Additionally, TrackerControl supports custom blocklists.

This approach
- reveals the companies behind tracking,
- allows to block tracking selectively, and
- exposes the purposes of tracking, such as analytics or advertising.

The app also aims to educate about your rights under Data Protection Law, such the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Under the hood, TrackerControl uses Android's VPN functionality, to analyse apps' network communications <i>locally on the Android device</i>. This is accomplished through a local VPN server, to enable network traffic analysis by TrackerControl.

No root is required, other VPNs or Private DNS are not supported. No external VPN server is used, to keep your data safe! TrackerControl even protects you against <i>DNS cloaking</i>, a popular technique to hide trackers in websites and apps.

TrackerControl은 연구 프로젝트의 일환으로, 언제나 오픈소스이자 무료로 남아있을 것입니다!
