TrackerControl allows users to monitor and control the widespread, ongoing, hidden data collection in mobile apps about user behaviour ('tracking').

To detect tracking, TrackerControl combines the power of the Disconnect blocklist, used by Firefox, and our in-house blocklist is used, created from analysing <i>~2 000 000</i> apps! Additionally, TrackerControl supports custom blocklists.

This approach

- reveals the companies behind tracking,
- allows to block tracking selectively, and
- exposes the purposes of tracking, such as analytics or advertising.

The app also aims to educate about your rights under Data Protection Law, such the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Under the hood, TrackerControl uses Android's VPN functionality, to analyse apps' network communications <i>locally on the Android device</i>. This is accomplished through a local VPN server, to enable network traffic analysis by TrackerControl.

No root is required, other VPNs or Private DNS are not supported. No external VPN server is used, to keep your data safe! TrackerControl beskytter dig endda mod <i>DNS-cloaking</i>, en populær teknik til at skjule trackere på hjemmesider og i apps.

Som forskningsprojekt vil TrackerControl altid være gratis og open source.
